# Pomodoro Timer
### Description:
The Pomodoro Timer is a simple application designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, which involves breaking work into intervals separated by short breaks. This technique aims to improve productivity and focus by alternating between periods of work and rest.
### Features:
1. Automatic Timer: Once the user hits the start button, the timer begins to count down automatically. The timer is set to 25 minutes by default, representing a standard Pomodoro work interval. This feature allows users to focus solely on their work without the need to manually monitor the timer.
2. Breaks: After each 25-minute work interval, the application automatically prompts a 5-minute short break. Users can use this time to rest, stretch, or briefly relax before resuming work.
3. Long Break: After completing four work intervals (a total of 100 minutes), the application provides a 20-minute long break. This extended break allows users to recharge and rejuvenate before starting the next work session.
4. Reset Option: Users have the option to reset the timer to 00:00 at any time using the reset button. This feature enables users to start a new work session or make adjustments as needed.
5. Checkmark Display: Upon the completion of each work or break session, a checkmark icon will be dynamically displayed on the screen.
### Technologies Used:
1. Python: The application is developed using Python programming language.
2. Tkinter: Tkinter is utilized for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application. It provides a simple and efficient way to create interactive components such as buttons, labels and check marks.
### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the Python script (main.py) using a Python interpreter.
4. Click the start button to begin the timer.
5. Focus on your task during the work interval.
6. When the timer reaches 00:00, take a short break.
7. Repeat the process for four work intervals.
8. After completing four intervals, enjoy a 20-minute long break.
9. Use the reset button to reset the timer for a new session.
